    Here I intend to babble about whatever thing I'm working on that I think is cool.
    <br>
    Eventually, I'll probably get a proper hosting system and make my devlog/blog better using some actual dynamic stuff, but this is what you're stuck with for now.
    <br>
    <a href="devlog.html">Here</a> is the link to said devlog page...
    <br>
    All of that aside, a small bit about me:
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li>- I tend to go by VividerAphid, Vi, Aphid, usually something of that nature in a non professional setting</li>
        <li>- I currently use JavaScript the most, as I have found its accessibility to me quite appealing</li>
        <li>- As you can likely tell, I'm likely more of a backend developer, though I <i>can</i> do frontend work if needed. Luckily, JavaScript exposes me to it a lot and I'm getting better at dealing with it</li>
    </ul>

        Lately I have two primary projects that I have been working on:
        <p>
            <h3>ClickCon</h3>
            Irritatingly enough, I realised about 2 years in that a photography convention also shared the same name and has the fancy domain site. Shrug.
            <br>
            Currently, (and for the last year and a half), I've been working half-ass on rewriting the entire thing from the ground up, as my motivation and time lining up is a rare, <i>rare</i> thing.
            <br>
            As of this line, I'm relatively close to finishing a stable version (likely less close than I think I am), and hopefully will release it sooner or later...
            <br>
            So what exactly <i>is</i> ClickCon?
